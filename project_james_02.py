'''
# CLI based app
# add, edit, delete, and search for contacts
# dictionaries, file handling, user input, error handling

1. User Interface (UI):
- Create a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for the Contact Management System.
- Display a welcoming message and provide a menu with the following options:

Welcome to the Contact Management System!

Menu:
1. Add a new contact
2. Edit an existing contact
3. Delete a contact
4. Search for a contact
5. Display all contacts
6. Export contacts to a text file
7. Quit

2. Contact Data Storage:
- Use nested dictionaries as the main data structure for storing contact information.
- Each contact should have a unique identifier (e.g., a phone number or email address) as the outer dictionary key.
- Store contact details within the inner dictionary, including:
- Name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Additional information (e.g., address, notes).

3.Menu Actions:
- Implement the following actions in response to menu selections:
- Adding a new contact with all relevant details.
- Editing an existing contact's information (name, phone number, email, etc.).
- Deleting a contact by searching for their unique identifier.
- Searching for a contact by their unique identifier and displaying their details.
- Displaying a list of all contacts with their unique identifiers.
- Exporting contacts to a text file in a structured format.

4. User Interaction:
- Utilize input() to enable users to select menu options and provide contact details.
- Implement input validation using regular expressions (regex) to ensure correct formatting of contact information.

5. Error Handling:
- Apply error handling using try, except, else, and finally blocks to manage unexpected issues that may arise during execution.

6. GitHub Repository:
- Create a GitHub repository for your project.
- Commit your code to the repository regularly.
- Create a clean and interactive README.md file in your GitHub repository.
- Include clear instructions on how to run the application and explanations of its features.
- Provide examples and screenshots, if possible, to enhance user understanding.
- Include a link to your GitHub repository in your project documentation.

7. Optional Bonus Points
- Contact Categories (Bonus): Implement the ability to categorize contacts into groups (e.g., friends, family, work). Each contact can belong to one or more categories.
- Contact Search (Bonus): Enhance the contact search functionality to allow users to search for contacts by name, phone number, email address, or additional information.
- Contact Sorting (Bonus): Implement sorting options to display contacts alphabetically by name or based on other criteria.
- Backup and Restore (Bonus): Add features to create automatic backups of contact data and the ability to restore data from a backup file.
- Custom Contact Fields (Bonus): Allow users to define custom fields for contacts (e.g., birthdays, anniversaries) and store this information.
