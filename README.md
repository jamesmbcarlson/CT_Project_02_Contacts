Project: Contact Management System

Author: James Carlson

This project was built as an assignment for Coding Temple.


Each contact that can be added to the address book can hold the following information:
 - Identifying Number   - A unique identifier that cannot be replicated across entries.
 - Name                 - Name fields are required and cannot be left blank.
 - Phone Number         - The phone field must contain a 10 digit phone number.
 - Email Address        - The email field must contain a valid email address.
 - Physical Address     - This field is optional, as an address can be entered in many different formats.
 - Additional Notes     - This field is optional and can contain whatever additional information the user wants to store.
 - Group                - This field is a list of categorizing groups, and can hold as many catagories as the user would like.


Using the command-line interface, the user will be prompted with the following options:

1. Add a new contact - 
    Enter information for a new contact, adding this contact and their details to the address book.

2. Edit an existing contact - 
    Edit the details for a contact currently in the address book.

3. Delete a contact - 
    Delete a contact currently in the address book.

4. Search for a contact - 
    Search for a contact by any detail in their entry, be it their name, phone number, email, or another field. This function is also employed by the editing and deleting functions.

5. Display all contacts - 
    Display the full list of contacts and their details to the terminal.

6. Export contacts to a text file - 
    Export all data in the program to a saved text file on the user's computer.

7. Import contacts from a text file - 
    Import data from a saved file, and use it to populate the address book within the program.
    An example file ("contact_directories/my_contacts.txt") has been provided in this project folder and can be loaded into the application using this function.

8. Quit - 
    Exit the application.
